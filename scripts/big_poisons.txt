The substance is the brainchild of one Korb Nagglebrek - a perverse halfling alchemist who dabbled in the dangerous field of time-travel. Discovered as Nagglebrek attmepted to convert a lime into the ideal time-travel fuel, the substance causes the victim to revert to an age where they felt the most joy in life. This sensation feels like the greatest release of pain and grief the victim has ever felt, as if one has not been able to cry for a decade. However this lasts only briefly, as then the substance catapults the victim forward in time, leaving them in their last moments of death. Korb has said of the substance that it is "not his worst work".|DC 18 Con save, then - if applicable - a DC 14 Wis save.

61|Clockmaker's Bane|Injury|A black, oily substance that looks almost exactly like mechanical grease or lanturn oil, it was origionally devised by the gnomish assassin, Perticulo, in responce to a request from a friend to dispose of a rival artificer. Magically refined from a mixture of lycanthrope blood, displacer beast saliva and black jelly residue, coupled with stablizing agents, it was specifically designed to kill slowly and appear to be natural progression of a disease while remaining non-magical in nature, so as not to alert the artificer and allied mages as to it's nefarious purpose. Given it's unusually persistant effectiveness, Perticulo refined and honed the recipe over many years and used it repeatedly as a subtle way to dispose of magically attuned folk and those prone to low vitality. His refinements caused it to lose some of it's potency and ease of deliverance, but remained a niche and effective tool in his arsenal for many years until he was eventually killed by a werebeaver, trying to procure more. The poison dissapeared from use for decades before his notes were eventually unearthed, and the Theives Guild began manufacturing and distributing it more abundently.|Must be applied with slashing or piercing damage only. The victim must make a DC 8 CON save. On a failure, they gain one level of fatigue. On a success, they gain -1 CON. The Constitution penalty cannot be restored or avoided without the use of a 5th level spell or higher (such as Greater Restoration). Fatigue inflicted by this poison cannot be cured through rest. This roll is repeated every 24 hours from the time of injury. The poison does not do damage, nor inflict the poisoned condition, and so cannot be resisted, and will not be detected by Detect Magic, nor will it be revealed by Detect Poison and Disease, unless the character specifically targets the viscous poison itself (note: once inside a victim, it will not be revealed in this fashion either, unless the character has knowledge of the poison and it's effects.) Once the victim has reached a -10 CON (10 sucessful saves, or more if Greater Restoration is used), the poison loses potency, and they regain 1 CON every 24 hours after for the next 10 days until they are back to their normal modifier, as well as recovering 1 level of exhaustion induced by the poison each day. The poison can be delayed indefinitely through Greater Restoration, but can only be neutralized before it's end through directed use of a curing or restoritive spell with specific knowledge of the poison (cannot be cured randomly with magic or non-specific antitoxins), or a 9th level spell (such as Power Word Heal, or Wish directed at curing the ailments of the victim.) The victim dies only if they reach 0 CON, or Level 6 Exhasion.|350 GP per vial from select, anti-arcane branches of the theives guild.
