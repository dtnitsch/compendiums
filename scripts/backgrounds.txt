You may notice that there are twenty items in every chart in this book. This makes using the UltimateToolbox that much easier.You can choose, roll, or blindly  ip through the book and steal what you need from the hundreds and hundreds of ideas throughout. Along the way, you’ll  nd sidebars like this one, giving helpful advice for alternative uses for even the most mundane charts. Just because it’s a pickpocket chart doen’t mean it’s not also a “for sale” chart or a list of items in a dead man’s pockets. Don’t let the titles of the charts dissuade you from years of happy gaming and writing inspiration. We’re going to say this a lot, but there is no wrong way to use this book.

Summer Solstice is the longest day of the year and occurs around June 22nd. This day marks when the tilt of the Earth’s axis is most orientated toward the sun. Midsummer’s Day is usually June 24th, about three days after the solstice itself. Similarly December 25th is the day the sun begins to return to the northern hemisphere. The Winter Solstice sun is positioned directly over the Earth’s equator on the shortest day of the year. The Fall equinox is September 23rd., when the sun is positioned directly over the Earth’s equator, and the Spring equinox is March 20th, when night and day are nearly the same length of time.

ROgUES
There’s much more for rogue characters in the city chapter where we delve into pick pocketing, hidden or improvised weapons, crime, punishment, bribes, and more. Now you don’t have to guess what’s in those picked pockets. See tables 3–95 through 3–121 to help  esh out your rogue character with some minor details about his craft.
There are also contacts and guilds in the same chapter, helping to  esh out a well- rounded urban thief character or NPC. It’s always a good idea to know who a rogue can trust and who he can lean on for favors.
