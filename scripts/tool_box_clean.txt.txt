3  Between the cold, crisp air and the dew covered ground, the forest feels almost magical and alive.
4  Carpet of ferns surround the pathway as the trees silently stand watch on either side.
5  Colorful fallen leaves conceal the pathway as the trees shelter the waning sun from sight.
6  Faint mist shrouds the tree trunks, making it difficult to see what awaits.
7  Fallen trees appear nice enough to sit on, a welcome rest from the thick underbrush.
8  Far off the trail, the trees and fallen leaves disguise a cave opening as being a mere hillside.

16  Tall, slender spruce trees line the reaches of the forest with patches of sun and sky peaking through.
17  Thick underbrush and low growing trees make it difficult to see a great distance ahead.
18  Underbrush has been cleared away near oak trees where the remnants of a camp can be seen.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?

Table 3–8: City History, Detailed
1  150 years ago an outcast dwarf clan set up a roadside smithy and business in this valley, used by transients from the surrounding human lands as a shortcut, chosen for its many hilly streams rumored to be rife with gold. This initial greed and spreading of rumors built up the community around the location, and while the gold has never made anyone rich, it still draws new prospects to its good location.
2  What began as a border town turned into a mass grave when merciless barbarians sacked and razed it to the ground. Once the nation reclaimed the border, the graves were marked and warded by a wall and monument. A settlement grew around the new trade and the city grew from the necropolis.
3  Built in a vale of great safety and beauty, a paladin order chose this spot to build their stronghold and move their families and friends. Soon, clerics of the paladins' faith flocked to visit and bless the site, and the same security and beauty that drew the paladins had many visitors relocate here permanently. 
4  Built on the site where a great dragon was defeated not more than 20 years ago, a community sprang up to support the treasure seekers and hunters who comb the nearby mountains searching for the beast's supposed multiple lairs to this day.
5  A brotherhood of celestial monks cornered and put down a great demon on this spot over 300 years ago. Defeat did not come easily for the creature, and the monks had to settle for encasing it in a great rune in the earth forged by magic of obsidian. They built their monastery on the spot to guard it eternally, and soon drew curious support from surrounding lands to the spot.
6  A cliffside dwelling of an ancient civilization which was revealed by an earthquake over 50 years ago continues to impress newcomers and explorers with its strong architecture and winding passages. Bards and magi agree there are no curses or hauntings to be found, and declared that to be so, which began a boon of movers soon after discovery.
7  The community was built around a gigantic stone golem. While inert, scholars and bards agree its runes speak of a prophecy of protection. Now the towering figure of an ancient hero stands silently among a field of buildings and roadways all depending on it in a time of need. 
8  Demand for a specific mineral clay found only in the nearby foothills drew miners, excavators, and dwarf ambassadors to this site long ago. The ability of the clay to be molded to replicate ivory and other materials keeps explorers of the mazelike tunnels around and beneath the city occupied. Numerous trade routes flow through the city, as well, increasing traffic.
9  Explorers found a great stone building containing a foundry, forge, and waterwheel, apparently run by elemental power. Sages eventually figured out the runes to command the trapped spirits, and a community built up around what has become a workhouse of industry and craft for the nation.
10  For 200 years this struggling border community tried to main a stable trading area for the northern realms, but barbarians and wild elves held that dream in check. A prince of an aging king of a nearby metropolis took his fortune and family and created a principality of the land, investing heavily in leading guilds here and creating a haven for trade caravans.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?
11  The great forest had long been exploited by the hobgoblin raiders of the western islands. An alliance between elves of the wood and men built a protective city at a natural harbor from which to launch patrol ships to keep the coast free of invasion.
12  Human engineers and their dwarf stone-guild allies spent a princely sum to complete a great stone bridge stone bridge connecting two interested but separated lands. The consortium collected large fees from anyone wishing to build at the new point of interest (either on a cliff bank or on the nearly 100 foot-wide bridge  itself ), and it grew very quickly thereafter. 
13  Obsidian Crest was a growing trade town until the nearby volcano - believed to be dormant - erupted. Because of the stone architecture used and the nearby gully's leading to the lake, many of the structures survived. When rebuilding began, the city planners encouraged wizards to build towers and accompanying wards to protect the city below.
14  Once a countrywide, sprawling noble estate, eventually five children inherited the land, divided it into districts, and attracted parties interested in their whims to their lands, slowly filling in the community and populating the fields. Old farmland slowly spread outward from the central city, which today is run by great-grandchildren of the founding nobles.
15  Originally the site of a military border keep where patrols from the central land flocked in droves to ensure security, the site grew and expanded as guard's families and supply businesses natural migrated to the area. More than a few brutal conflicts have been fought there in years past. Now the city thrives, still basing most of its income on military spending.
16  Over 100 years ago the great hero Galston Magus led a small army against the forces of a neighboring nation that had been bolstered with demonic warriors. When the hero and his team finally won the day, a camp was erected from across the blasted battlefield. As support came for the troops and the border was determined, permanent buildings were finally set in place and Galston was named mayor.
17  Religious pilgrims, persecuted for their multi-pantheon faith, fled their homeland until they came to an ancient spiraled tower. It was abandoned, but contained runes of many gods. The faithful settled here and the curiosity slowly drew others. Buildings grew around and near the spire, which slowly grew to the city-state it is today.
18  Scholars came for years to study towering, monolithic standing stones until one university sponsored a field trip with its best decipherers. While still very little progress was made, the college built an outpost and soon a community to support it was built within the great ring.
19  A team of explorers discovered a portal beneath the surface in the darklands leading to other worlds. The last magical communication with their families before they vanished kicked off a decade of researchers, wizards, and rescuers studying the ancient device. Support soon formed a community and before long a city.
20  Upland communities finally had enough of the longship raiding from the land's northern barbaric neighbors. They gathered church and royal sponsors and built a protective wall to guard the mouth of the river and build up the nations' best ship manufacturer.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?

Table 3–9: City Description, Detailed
1  Amoeboid in shape, this irregular city straddles a fork in a great river. An irregular wall of many small towers tightly surrounds the community. A series of bridges and docks are found on the waterfronts. The quarters are castle, noble, commons and gold. The gold quarter is dominated by large mining and smithy businesses and guilds.
2  A circular city built on the side of a steep hill, the walls are stone and broken by many fortified towers. From top to bottom, the city has castle, nobility, market, and residential quarters. Large buildings are not in vogue; instead a small, simple dwelling or design is favored by all. 
3  Built into a wedge cliff beside a tall mountain, this city has a single simple wall blocking the one mouth to the community. Towering stair sections lead up to the many districts in the cliffside itself, including guard and jail, red-light, guild, residential, and magic. Below on the ground the city is divided temple, keep, noble, and warehouse quarters.
4  The dock ward of this seaside city sits outside the common, irregularly-walled community, which is itself divided into two by a tall wall. In the smaller district are the market, warehouse, and caravan districts intermixed with slums. In the larger are the keep, guild, and wealthy residential districts. The outside docks sprawl with wooden buildings and act as another third of the city.
5  Hexagonal in shape, a single river runs directly through the city, and a sturdy simple stone wall surrounds it. One large bridge dominates the center of town and is part of the castle. Smaller docks can be found irregularly along the river. There is a park of considerable size in one quarter with a small lake. The districts are guard, market, military, slums, and aristocrat.
6  An irregularly shaped wall dominated by massive towers surrounds this city, which straddles a river mouth as it empties into a larger body. Docks line the entire open end, and the keep is in the northeast quadrant in the government quarter. Others quarters are residential, market, and warehouse (which is mostly in the dock quarter).
7  An "L" shaped city wall takes advantage of the mountainous hill where the castle sits surrounded by government buildings and mansions in the noble quarter. Below the city is divided into remaining quarters (business, residential, and temple) by extra wide, well-patrolled roads.
8  This multi-section walled city surrounds a natural cove harbor, with high points rising to the crest of each side of the bay. A keep acts as a gatehouse leading to the central section of town, where the castle and government buildings lie. The central city is used for market, taverns and inns, ship repair and warehouses. Two sections divided from the central city by low walls at opposite ends house the wealthy residents in one and the common folk in the other.
9  Nestled deep in a forest is this elf city, mostly consisting of elf businesses and homes built above in the trees and visitor's quarters of market, inn, magic, and temple on the ground below. A careful gully system filled with wooden traps surrounds the city in a natural way difficult to spot for invaders. In only three places does a large, natural-looking giant tree bridge span these defenses.
10  Nicknamed Five Points, this oval high-walled city acts as a crossroads for five major roads that pass through this community to the surrounding nations. The wide roads divide the city into temple, market, inn, embassy, and noble districts respectively. 

? CHAPTER THREE  ?
11  No wall surrounds this city among the pines, with a combination keep and walled university at the center, slowly spanning out into other districts as allowed by the deep valleys nearby. Building styles are extra strong. The many small districts include embassy, tavern, noble, residential, guildhall, and marketplace.
12  Octagonal walls surround a high hill where the castle is situated, looking down on the city. Government buildings are nestled tightly around the hill. The tavern, guard, caravan, warehouse, wealthy, and common residential districts span out from the government buildings to the walls.
13  Oval in shape, this city straddles the north bank of a mighty river. Two levels of hill surround the community, each topped by a reinforced wooden wall with watchtowers. The keep is by the riverside, surrounded by the dock ward, marketplace, commons, red light district, and guild quarter.
14  Oval-shaped city with few but high towers dividing the wall. One edge of the city sits aside a great cliff face, with a natural caravan road leading down to the lowlands below. Two gatehouses lead visitors to the west and north from the city. The castle sits in the center, surrounded by the residential, guild, market, and caravan quarters.
15  A perfectly rectangular city built with double walls in many places was built ambitiously, for there are still open fields between the central community and the walls which 50 years have not yet filled. There are east and west gates only, as the city straddles a great trade route. Vegetation is plentiful in and around the buildings. The quarters are trade, residential, military, and market.
16  A sprawling city in a giant clearing uses the thick, oppressive jungle surrounding it as a defense, patrolled from many small watchtowers and guardhouses. A fourth side is a small natural harbor.   A castle with a moat sits toward the center, surrounded by the inn, dock, guild, residential, noble, and ambassador's quarters. Small streams divide the quarters, with patrolled bridges to access each.
17  A sprawling metropolis built at the mouth of a river, no wall surrounds this community built in and among the various tributaries of the river. Bridges and spans cross the waterways, and docks and ferries are plentiful. The districts include dock, warehouse, market, wealthy and average residential, and castle (containing a number of fortress-like holds of the government). 
18  A three-sectioned wall cuts off the entrance to this mountain community originally founded by dwarves (who remain the dominant population). Squat, stone buildings dominate the area outside and within the cavern, with residential areas on the cave walls. The keep and military quarter are outside, while the market, guild, and then noble quarters follow more deeply within the cave. 
19  Triangular in shape, this small city is surrounded by wall and moat alike. A grand keep sits at the center, where a highway of three adjoining roads (each with its own towering wooden covered bridge) converge from outside the city. The crowded districts include caravan, inn and tavern, military, market, slum, residential, and temple.
20  The walls of the city square it off around a major crossroads between lands. The market district dominates the center of town at the crossroads, where the keep is also located. Surrounding it are the districts for guards, residential, slums, military, and theater.

14  Dull colorless buildings moist with dew from lakeside mist. Simple wooden palisade wall.
15  Gothic, spiked walls of black basalt surround this circular city with an abundance of watchtowers.
16  Gothic towers and monuments paint the city a dreary shade, as the walls pen in the citizens.
17  Half city, half wilderness. Bushes, trees, gardens, and lawns integrate perfectly with buildings.
18  Huge deepwater port lines one side of the city, and its river continues inland around the solid walls.
19  Large central city has a road leading down to a second, smaller city dock ward by the seaside.
20  Lower city lies in shadow of cliffside upper district with a single road leading between the two.

Table 3–64: Monument Description
1  Arch, made of white marble and infused with lines of cobalt blue, formed at the apex like strong, gauntlet-covered hands in friendship or accord.
2  Catacombs, showing burial pits and ledges, various rites and symbols meant to protect the departed from thieves, historians, or necromancers. 
3  Cenotaph, depicting Korov, a mighty general of the goblinkin wars from the Age of Deception, with his trio of mighty wardogs at his side.
4  Columns, with decorative lines as if a dragon's claws had grasped them and run down the sides, every line varying in width and depth.
5  Crypt, interring the many nameless and forgotten souls who have been found dead in the city over the years, sponsored by a suspicious ruler.
6  Druidic stone circle, each a slightly different oval shape with a single rune on them of a forgotten tongue, scarred where spellcasters have tried divining their meaning.
7  Grave stones, carved in the shapes of runes representing the birth signs of the deceased to protect them and as a tribute to their ages.
8  Historic keep/watchtower, with designs of shells and sea creatures in homage to the mermaid scions of the undersea kingdom of Arquatonia.
9  Mausoleum, of the Berkshire family and their servants, who helped give the current people their vision for the city and nation they call home.
10  Memorial, for the Company of the Fyrespyke Staff, defenders of the Prince of Ash, who became king after a revolt against the tyrannical Arychast the Usurper.
11  Obelisk, each side dedicated to one elemental god and its avatars, genies, or servants who helped shape the world by combining their might (from a creation myth).
12  Palace, with high spires meant by the builder to challenge (and pay homage to) the great monuments of the giant lords of old. 
13  Pyramid, with the very top portion missing, making a small flat space deliberately left by the original architects for some unknown reason. 
14  Shrine, for the goddess of magic, crafted of worked metal fused with stone, impervious to unhallowed curses and any misuse by her foes.
15  Spire, with a curve just enough to resemble a colossal beast's claw or tooth, reaching out from the earth, bone-chillingly realistic.
16  Statue, of an ancient knight with a star mark on his head, riding a six-legged horse atop the clouds, a truly marvelous representation by a master craftsman.
17  Terminating vista, the coliseum of the savage ancient tribes where great mock battles were fought for the gods' enjoyment and judgment.
18  Triumphal arch, with both edges bearing the family names and runes of the respective warriors who perished fighting to free the land from bugbear slavers.
19  Tomb, for the giant Boskir, who led the pilgrimage of the ancient gods to the lands of promise, as ordained by the god of prophecy.
20  War memorial, for the heroes of the dwarf war, honoring the greatest human and elf allied generals, who finally bought their people together as one.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?

Table 3–65:  statue Description
1  Blue and white marbled statue. When light shines on it, it captures and magically reflects the light back in a kaleidoscope of colors. "In honor of Oben Dreamweaver" is inscribed on it.
2  Elf Tree of Light. This pure white oak tree's leaves are platinum in color. The tree's girth is wider then the arm span of a dozen elves.
3  Gathrak's Lagacy. A statue of Gathrak the legendary troll of the northern marshes. Graffiti - written in several languages - covers part of it.
4  Golden statue of the king standing with his foot on the head of a dragon, based on an old tale often told by bards. 
5  Huge anchor cast in bronze lies near the wharf. When touched, a name can be uttered and that name, providing it is of one who truly was lost at sea, appears on the massive base.
6  Huge fully armed figure cast in pure obsidian from top to base stands tall. Its armor is spiked and its hands rest on the hilt of its sword, which rests point down into the base. 
7  Huge obsidian stone statue of a spider spans the street, forcing people to walk beneath its belly.  Its origins are unknown.
8  Large silver unicorn statue acts as the centerpiece of a large fountain. At night the unicorn's horn glows brightly, providing a soft light to all those who tarry around it.
9  Marble statue of an elf rises from the base and roots of an ancient tree. The tree must have been massive while it lived, and the figure's meticulous craftsmanship suggests a nonhuman sculptor.
10  Monument of an elf riding a wolf and holding a book, its backpack overflowing with scrolls.  It is titled Tristam's Legacy.
11  Pillar of souls, a monolith made entirely of skulls. Stark white in color, mist appears to spill out from the mouths rising to the sky. When wind blows the right way it sounds like it is moaning.
12  Primitive statue stands at the entrance to the city. Made of local stone and weathered by time it still stands its full eight feet tall. In goblin the plaque states  Uglemesh great leader and king of mighty clans.
13  Serpent's Rock. This enormous rock is shaped like a dragon. On the belly is a memorial to a silver dragon that once defended the area.
14  Small stone, about the size of a large tome, lies half in and half out of the ground. It seems a marker of some sort but the writing is difficult to make out. 
15  Statue of an armored knight. "To honor all those who fell before you" is inscribed at the base. Foul markings have been scribed on its surface.
16  Statue of a plate-armored figure with his sword raised high and the symbol of the god of valor on his shield. "In honor of Laramo who valiantly strove against evil no matter the odds."
17  Stones hang in a perfectly circular formation from their bases, each one carved with a historical scene which spirals down from base to tip in chronological order.

Table 3–66: Gravestone Description
1  Aldeman Targath: Lived 68 years, died 2 months ago.    "Merchant, Mayor, Friend" is marred by graffiti that reads "Burn in Hell."
2  Shane Ashar: Lived 82 years, died 47 years ago.   His headstone has fallen down and cracked in half. "Patriarch of the Finneran Clan."
3  Brother Silas: Lived 47 years, died 73 years ago.   The weather-worn plaque on his gravestone reads, "May his next life be as full as this one was."
4  Darlen Olafsdottir: Lived 23 years, died 19 years ago.   "A life for a life, mother to daughter. We miss you, always."
5  Eldara Sinaralin: Lived 659 years, died 7 years ago.   An arrow trailing sparks behind it across a crescent moon is carved into her headstone.
6  Esmeralda Tetkith: Lived 113 years, died 17 years ago.  "Best cook in the land," followed by "Always go easy on the basil. Too much can overwhelm the stew."
7  Herrin Charlas: Lived 21 years, died 4 years ago.  "Beloved son, brave warrior. Evil took him from us too soon."
8  Hettie Bonchell: Lived 38 years, died last week.  "Dearest soul mate, wondrous mother" is partially obscured by a flowered grave blanket.
9  Ilsa Trueweave: Lived 482 years, died 26 years ago.  "World's Greatest Illusionist." A permanent illusion makes the words flash in different colors.
10  Kanira Petal: Lived 12 years, died 14 years ago.  A single wildflower grows on her grave, and the angel-topped headstone reads,  "Sleep well, little one. Our Lady holds thee now."
11  Lerthan Hammerhand: Lived 178 years, died 87 years ago. His sturdy, black stone monument has a carving of an anvil, a hammer, and tongs on it.  It looks as though it is cleaned regularly.
12  Oltar Keselmun: Lived 60 years, died 8 years ago.   This headstone is small and simple. It is overgrown with weeds and neglected.
13  Phinean Kanter: Lived 34 years, died 8 years ago.   His simple marker is covered in filth. Beneath the grime, it reads, "May he know no peace."
14  Rendril Batenford: Lived 211 years, died 28 years ago. A baying wolf and a wickedly curved blade are carved on his monument.
15  Seldin Ironhand: Lived 51 years, died 12 years ago.   A huge monument topped with a holy symbol and carved with accounts of his deeds marks this grave.  The guards next to it, hired from a mercenary company in perpetuity, only reinforce this paean to his ego.

17  Thog: Lived 32 years, died 2 years ago.   "The gentlest of giants, protector of our children." Toys, seemingly left in tribute, lie about the headstone.
18  Tomas Alrain Ixelmeier: Lived 4 years, died 6 years ago.A lamb is carved into this headstone, and fresh flowers lie on top of the grave.
19  Yaniza El-Fariq: Lived 26 years, died 3 years ago.   A craven sigil is carved into the strange stone marker, defaced by the word "Witch" painted on it in red.
20  Zyndris Farseer: Lived 96 years, died 10 years ago.  This is in the shape of a pedestal with a book on it. Inscribed on the book is a quote:  "True wisdom flows from the heart, not the mind."

Religion

Table 3–122: Church Descriptions, Detailed
1  All doors and windows of the church face south. It has a nave with three chapels, a choir alcove, two altars in the transept, and a main altar. To the north of the main altar are a belfry and a sacristy. The convent, which forms an annex to the church, now houses an archaeological museum where holy relics captured in crusades into evil lands in ages past are displayed.
2  Building is actually an ancient mansion left to the church, only recently secured by church funds. Inside are sprawling rooms dedicated to different aspects of the deity. The walls have been left intact, so while there is no one common hall of worship, many smaller ceremonies are simultaneously going on.
3  Building housing the church is shaped like a morningstar or mace, with a long entry hall showcasing many of the shields or banners used by the faithful when going to battle. At the business end, the building branches out like a star, with the main worship hall in the center and clerics' quarters, high priest's retreat, holy relics, and care and health halls branching outward.
4  Built into a gigantic tree in the center of the community which dwarfs all those around it. The tree is an icon of the deity and is said to have grown with the blessing of the god. Both naturally hollowed-out rooms and man-made additions on sturdy branches hold the various offices and prayer chambers of the faithful, a majestic natural stair winding up to all.
5  Church consists entire of connected towers, the main hall divided by a screen depicting saints and scenes from the religion's history. Gray slate and white beams are used to help support the towers and their multiple levels. There are no chairs or pews; during ceremonies all worshippers are expected to stand. Small towers toward the edges of the property house the church's popular meditation pools.
6  Church is built around the skeleton of an ancient dragon that perished trying to force the faithful from the land in years past. The skeleton acts as the framework for the walls; the head an atrium, its ribcage the worship hall, and the tail and limbs leading to clerics' chambers and rooms of solitude. Thin, clear ultra-thick glass windows all face the sunset.
7  Church of magic is built into the side of an ancient and now-dormant volcano, shaped through spells to form the volcanic glass into walls and towering spires dedicated to the deity. It all has a very organic feel; the magic used created ultra-smooth glass walls and flowing hallways rounded and calming to those who walk them. There are icons of the faith about, but they are small, leaving the majority of the place very open and accessible.
8  Church was destroyed in a magical storm and the current high cleric continues the services among the ruins. Stone walls with dangerous rubble removed are all that remains around simple tents used to house the clerics of the deity. They believe themselves unworthy and make amends to the deity. They refuse any outside aid, saying when they have atoned the church will rise again.
9  Designed in a simple disk shape, with a domed ceiling made of material to capture the light of the sun and keep it in at all times of day or night. Inside are many curved balconies, with stair and ladder access leading to study rooms with books, meditation chambers with resting facilities, and  clerics' quarters.
10  Entrance of the church is full of fine wall paintings and the interior is entirely gold-painted. Domed towers encircle the main building at all points of the compass. The roof is ringed by gargoyles. The main atrium has an ivy-covered altar and marble floors flanked with nearly 20 alcoves, where eternal candles burn. The windows have been bricked up to form archer holes.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?
11  Hollowed-out stone cave by the shoreline with a path leading to it. Inside the walls are decorated with the paraphernalia of the deity and its faithful. While it is essentially one great worship hall, there are many side caves where clerics rest and goods are stored. Candles flickering from shore winds give the place a look of movement.
12  Monastery stands surrounded by huge pine trees. Many outbuildings have been converted to schools to teach the children of the land. It is partially famous for a statue of the god of learning, which is said to weep from time to time over the curse of ignorance. 
13  Most of its buildings converted to a hospital during a time of war and its primary function shifted to this after that time. Within the walled perimeter can be found a small grove of ancient olive trees said to promote the healing magic of the faith. The church is not overly adorned with holy relics, but many chambers now serve a more practical purpose for patients of the land.
14  Part of a gigantic stone bridge, built by the faithful in ages past to connect two warring nations. Accessed by entrances on either side, its roof is crossed by marching soldiers and beast-drawn wagons. Underneath are the rooms of clerics, a great worship hall suspended over the waterway below, and facilities in the arches of the bridge for storing holy weapons and relics.
15  Part of this church was accidentally burnt down in recent times and is currently under reconstruction. Three small chapels are on the holy ground owned by the church, with a long pergola covered in grape vines between them and the main domed building, which houses cleric quarters and the main altar. The main building has marble floors. 
16  A ruin, what stones remain are scorched, the land around it appears salted or cursed, the walls invaded by vines of ivy. There are several pikes with bodies impaled upon them. The church was burned down by a necromancer, lore says, and the bodies are his and those of his undead. The church followers were victorious over the defilers. However, the  rebuiling effort has haulted, showcasing the dead as a warning to godless villains.
17  Ruler of the kingdom took a deep personal interest in the otherwise unremarkable church and commissioned a well-known artist to paint large imposing murals on the ceiling, columns, and walls of the square and rigid buildings and the atrium. The windows are all circular and filled with green and blue stained glass.
18  Shrine's first floor is halfway below ground level, judging by the low windows. The women of the church are multi-talented: some paint icons, others embroider vestments and items for liturgical use. Hand-painted eggs are famous around the land, as are the sisters' prayer ropes, bookmarks, and other crafts. The church members make incense for use in ceremonies and for private prayer, which is usually done in the many private alcoves.
19  Temple consists of the main building, both grandiose and towering, and several outbuildings built nearby which have been annexed by the church in its many years. It shows signs of obvious wealth, with grand chandeliers and luxurious tapestries woven by masters of the church. Statues of saints holding fonts of holy water, symbols of the faithful, and holy cloth are common and usually of bronze, silver, and even gold.
20  Two massive towers straddle the main building of this oval-shaped temple, with massive pillars holding up a partial roof around the circumference of the church. Inside the oval building is a large inner courtyard with a sundial, around which are a cloistered walkway and numerous cells and halls. The vaulted ceilings of the halls are tastefully painted with floral decorations and scenes from the church scriptures.

? CHAPTER THREE  ?
Table 3–140: Guild Adventures 1
1  Guild asks the PCs to investigate the city sewer system under certain guild houses to be sure they aren't using the ducts for purposes other than removing waste.
2  Guild claims innocence when a band of mercenaries begins roughing up its members for "shoddy workmanship." Who is behind this bullying?
3  Guild discovers two vital tomes missing from an until-recently neglected portion of its library.  A former member turned swampland hermit is suspected, and the PCs are hired to retrieve the books at any cost.
4  Guild member approaches a PC. He believes a rival is trying to kill him. He asks the PC to investigate while he hides in the city.
5  Guild member is attacked by a lycanthrope and it's nearly a full moon. She wants the PCs to escort her to a priest in the next town who can help quickly, keep it quiet, and protect innocents.
6  Guild members who have their business cut by local humanoids who excel at their craft (dwarves for stonework and elves for bowmaking) demand action.
7  Guild rivalries are so strong, open attacks on the street are common. Recently a group of innocent bystanders were injured, and now the townsfolk want something done.
8  Guild rivalry turns bitter and violent when a high-ranking journeyman of one guild turns up dead. The PCs are asked to help intervene, but once involved find more culpable guild members.
9  Guild's contacts start to dry up in the city, being replaced or bought out by a rival or enemy of the guild. Once the economy is "locked down," no one will be able to operate without approval.
10  Guildmaster friend of the PCs is suffering from a seemingly incurable and painful illness. While healers have high hopes, he asks them to help him run the guild temporarily.
11  High-ranking guild member seeks out the PCs to sponsor him for the next rank. There is much at stake, and perhaps the PCs can't agree on who should sponsor the NPC.
12  High-ranking member of the guild hears of the PCs' exploits and wants to hire them for a "personal matter." He wants a family member escorted out of the city for protection.
13  Important specific trail maps have been stolen from a wayfarer's guild and the PCs are asked to retrieve them. Do they lead somewhere someone wants kept a secret?
14  It is said an astronomer's guild has uncovered a dire prediction for the land, but those few suspected of being members have disappeared.
15  It is suspected that caravans guarded by the guardsmen's guild are hit harder than others, and some members may be leaking route info to bandits.
16  Large numbers of flawed magic scrolls appear in the marketplace and links tie this back to the wizard's guild. But is the answer this simple?
17  Local respected bard is being paid by businesses (who don't respect the guild hierarchy) to plant tales of corruption among the townfolk.
18  Local respected bard is being paid by businesses (who don't respect the guild hierarchy) to plant tales of corruption among the townfolk.

20  One of the PCs' teachers in the guild was overly harsh to three other apprentices in recent weeks. Now that instructor turns up dead.
 

? CHAPTER THREE  ?
Table 3–141: Guild Adventures 2
1  Outstanding merchant with consistent business refuses to join the guild. Some members want him pushed into joining, while others respect his privacy. Could he be using materials or practices that the guild forbids?
2  Paranoid and bitter guildmaster hires a group of wizards to help him run his guild, using divination magic to uncover traitors and spies. Unfortunately,  some known honest merchants (even PCs' allies) are targeted.
3  PCs' guildmaster receives a promotion to a new city and must leave a successor, here. No one in this city is fit to govern, nor does he trust anyone. Without a guildmaster, the PCs must keep tabs on the infighting that follows.
4  PCs' guildmaster receives a blackmail note. It's something she didn't do, but the culprit claims to have evidence to the contrary.
5  PCs overhear that a group has learned of the next meeting place of a highly secretive guild. They plan to spy and sell the secrets if the can.
6  PCs are set up to "accidentally" overhear a plot to assassinate the guildmaster to test their loyalty.
7  PCs uncover a plot between guilds wherein stargazers' guild predicts a massive drought destroying crops so the various farm and food guilds can raise prices in response, giving the stargazers a cut.
8  Powerful evil creature seeks to usurp a guild to ensure control over a facet of business in which it has great interest, and the PCs run afoul of the plot.
9  Rotten guildmaster has been arrested. Many suspect there are many still loyal to him in the ranks. The PCs are asked to work with the jailed guildmaster to hunt down these remaining members.
10  Royalty whose coffers are running dry begins plotting to take over the nearest and most profitable guilds by planting relatives in key positions.
11  Several small guilds (with an equal number of members) each try to gain notoriety over the others. A famous adventurer might be the answer, and each guild aggressively tries to recruit the PC.
12  Small community guild slipping in power wants to lure masters from a nearby city to join its ranks and increase its prestige. They are willing to go (deeply) into debt to secure the right people.
13  Some merchants are getting too comfortable with the guild's advantages and as a result let their work slack off, much to the dismay of the honest merchants.
14  Someone on the inside, close to the guildmaster, is betraying the guild's secret signs to a bunch of thieves, probably for a cut.
15  Stubborn, rich noble wishes to start a rival guild to one already established because he wants to be guildmaster.
16  Two guildmasters, of vastly different organizations, consider joining their guilds as one despite the bizarre membership trials and complexity that would be involved.
17  Well-respected member of the community wins a long bid to become guildmaster, but a powerful adventurer comes to town hunting this person for crimes against his family long ago.
18  When many members are confronted with late dues, they all insist they already paid. Soon is it is learned that someone is posing as the guild's dues collector, having made off with the money.
19  While on route to a lucrative treaty meeting, two guildmasters are waylaid by highwaymen, who demand an outrageous ransom.
20  Young apprentice friend of the PCs injures himself or has a prize craft stolen and cannot pay his dues or rent. The guild does not extend  favors to members of his rank.

Table 3–154: Overheard Conversations
1  Ah, my friend. I have some terrible news to tell you tonight. Please, bear with me. This comes at an awkward time, I have meetings and speeches to be written.
2  Do you think she knows? I don't know how I ever let you talk me into this... No, and she won't either. There are plenty I've met who then never remember my face.
3  Fortune favors you, the stars tell us the Ritual of Astaghast must be done in three days. And if it doesn't I don't want to even think of the evils that will befall us all.
4  How much does he owe you now anyway and why do you keep letting this slip? Too much, but he's good for it. I have ways of collecting that he fears I'll use.
5  I can't meet with you later, I have an appointment with the Duke and you know him... He's no good; don't fall for his cheap lines and wealth, he's a shallow heel of a man.
6  I'm a dock worker not a priest. Stop being stupid and let me handle things. You're dealing with people out of your element, these are guardsmen of nobility!
7  I'm glad the old man is dead. If anyone had any idea of his recent activities...  Why don't you tell them? Show Tutorilis' degradations to the world, the old monster!
8  Its terrible news, they said his head was missing and they can't find her either. She's got Family outside of town, but it's far away, she'll have to charter a coach or ship.
9  I've heard their bond is unnatural. It gives me the shivers to even think of it. They speak of an unholy alliance in his history, the blood of a devil is in his past.
10  Just give me two days to have this settled. I swear you won't have any complaints. But he was known to dabble in necromancy; my superiors won't wait any longer.
11  The Haunted Lady will be pleased. I look forward to working with you again. Not a chance, I nearly got caught and I'm out of this business as of right now, sorry.
12  The sword cut through the beast like butter. It is said to have runes of a god on the hilt.  I don't care about that. I just want to know what I can get for it.
13  The prince is calling for a special audience. I'm sure he's going to name his bride to all.  Good grief, I hope it's not that barbarian. He'll lose all respect from the nobles.
14  They are headed for the Hills of Skulldug, and they are bringing the scroll with them. If we leave now we can cut them off at Hangman's Crossing. Let's go!
15  They say you know how to contact Simand the alchemist, we have need for his specialty. Perhaps I do and perhaps I don't. You have my usual fee, I presume...?
16  They're saying the Oracle has been taken by the Red Cloak Clan, I feel sorry for her... Not as sorry as I feel for them, she sees all; she expected this and is using them.
17  So I said to him, the guild doesn't accept items like this, and he said oh... they will!  He's taking an awful risk, but he knows his business. I envy him that leverage.
18  Take this. It's very dangerous so don't open it until the time is right and you won't be seen. You can trust me. I have never failed to deliver for you yet, relax. I mean it.
19  Twenty gold bars, it can't be traced, and all you have to do is keep your mouth shut. Twenty more and I'll make sure your brother never talks about it either.
20  You can't tell him you know what he will do. I'll be killed for certain... You told me you had an out, that all would be safe.

Table 5–29: Corridor Hazards
1  Along the left wall are five small holes with small bits of ash in each
2  Behind the door is a spring-loaded trap that triggers if opened more than halfway
3  Brick on the ground seems to have a heavy acidic smell coming from it
4  Ceiling tile appears reflective, as if it wasn't really stone
5  Floor and walls are checkered; the light-colored ones are reflective, but produce a horrid image of the looker; if avoided and someone steps only on the black ones the trap is set off
6  Foul smelling breeze is coming through cracks and small holes in the wall
7  Ground feels very soft and roller-like, as if it would start to roll anyone standing on it forward
8  Ground is smooth but there are a lot of grains of sand all around
9  Hall is pitch black and rumbles loudly as light approaches it
10  In the middle of the floor, the cement is cracked as if something big keeps running down the middle
11  Large circular stone in the middle of the floor has debris around it, as if it had been spinning
12  Many holes on the ground look as though they contain spikes within them
13  Many small smooth holes look as through something has eaten away at the stonework
14  Stone debris on the ground and walls appears to have been struck repeatedly with something large
15  Stone is slightly discolored and smooth compared to the rest
16  Stone walls have a smooth feel to them, as if someone had sanded them down
17  Torch seems to have a small hole just underneath it that is emitting some heat
18  Wall has a lever; upon close inspection the wall is a trap that falls inward on anyone pulling the lever.
19  Walls are made of small perfect red bricks with mortar in between; mortar feels cold to the touch
20  Wooden floor feels hollow in places, as though no foundation lie beneath

Table 5–31:  Archways
1  Archway carved from a single piece of ice, clear as a sheet of glass topped with a swan ice sculpture
2  Appears as a giant skeletal maw, with prominent fangs above which seemed polished to a shine
3  Blemished with a few fossilized bugs within, these fused amber blocks in the grand old tree open into darkness
4  Carved out of a single piece of marble, this arch demonstrates the artist's dedication
5  Concealed by earth and time, this subtle arch is easily dismissed as a mere entrance to a cave
6  Constructed of hundreds of interlocking arm bones of all manner of humanoid creatures
7  Both sides of the gray stone archway contain a keyhole, and yet no door can be seen
8  Giant skeletons form the archway, grasping bony fingers more than 15 feet above
9  Made from granite blocks, the simple archway is large enough for a horseman to pass
10  Magical mists of unknown origin continually cascade down from above, blocking the view beyond
11  Magically molded out of a single piece of slate and colored with veins of silver throughout
12  More a whole in the wall than an archway, this iron arch is guarded by two eagle sculptures
13  Pillars of ancient kings stand at each side, raised swords touching high above to form the arch
14  Polished golden bricks form an arch of near-impossible angles, twists, and turns
15  Single piece of sandstone, made to look like multiple bricks, each with an ancient rune carving
16  Stairs lead to this perfectly square archway, four feet to a side and decorated with dwarf runes
17  Strange, rancid fungus clings to the sandstone archway, dripping occasional ooze to the floor below
18  Tarnished silver snakes twisting around each other, all trying to eat a raven at the top of the arch
19  Undecipherable glyphs of ancient origin glow when anyone passes through this basalt stone archway
20  Vine-covered granite carved into the shape of a black dragon's wings, which form the entrance

Trappings

Table 5–32: Secret Doors
1  Bookcase swings away from the wall to reveal a passageway.  Pulling a particular book back opens the door.  It leads to a private study.
2  Brick wall behind a fireplace slides upward.  Opens by pushing in the brick that sticks out a little more than the rest.  Narrow staircase leads to a narrow space between the walls of the floor above.
3  Circular symbol on the floor pivots depending on how much weight is on it.  Placing all the weight on one side reveals a secret passageway, while placing all the weight on the other side sets off a deadly trap.
4  Covered by both a floor rug and a desk, this secret door has a cast iron ring to open it.  There is a poison trap, however.  Door opens to reveal an old staircase leading to a silenced dungeon cell.  
5  Fountain moves aside, revealing a five-foot-wide slide that descends into blackness. Door opens when anything in Abyssal is spoken within five feet.  At the bottom is the lair of a giant cobra.
6  Front face of a tree swings inward to reveal a staircase into a well lit room.  Trigger is stepping on a certain piece of root of that same tree.  Below is a secure torture chamber. 
7  Garden hedge leans to one side, revealing a passageway down.  Hedge door opens by turning the sundial to face the south instead of north.  Below the surface is the lair of a giant sentient plant.
8  Gazebo floor lifts, revealing a staircase of stones jutting out from a dirt wall.  It's opened by first jumping up and down on it three times. At the staircase bottom lies a small shrine to a dark god. 
9  Heavy block wall falls backward and magically rights itself back up ten seconds later.  Opening it requires brute strength.  Leads to a war room filled with detailed maps and intelligence reports of local military forces.
10  Inside of a closet is second door made to look like another section of wall.  Door opens by removing a coat from a specific hook. Passageway leads to a dressing room with various outfits.
11  Mouth of massive dragon head opens enough for a human to crawl through.  Activated by one person staring into each eye.  Opens to the secret HQ of the Dual Dragon Assassins.
12  Picture on the wall slides downward.  Opens by leaning back in one of the chairs in the room.  Door opens to a narrow shaft going up and down with a ladder inside.
13  Piece of the wall simply vanishes to reveal a doorway.  Door opens by turning a stone statue around backward to face the wall.  Leads to an alchemist laboratory.  
14  Rear panel of a nonfunctioning clock swings opens.  Activate door by moving both hands to the number five.  Door opens to a secret library with books detailing the various planes.
15  Removing the top of an elaborate bed reveals a small passageway and a ladder leading down.  The mattress must be removed since the frame conceals it.  Passageway is an emergency escape route.
16  Section of the ceiling near the bookshelf rolls back, revealing a passageway, triggered by lighting three specific candles on the nearby chandalier. It leads to the secret HQ of the local thieves' guild.
17  Several offset stone blocks from the wall swing inward.  Opens by pushing in a loose brick several feet away.  Door opens to a dark staircase leading downward.
18  Sunburst design on the floor descends to a staircase.  Opens by crushing a gem in the mouth of golden ram statuette in the same room.  Staircase leads to a lower level of the structure.
19  When removing the door knob from left side of the door and attaching it to the right, it opens to reveal a portal. The portal leads to a land thousands of miles away.
20  Wooden floor carefully conceals a hidden entryway.  Door opens by lifting where the knothole is.  Leads to a crawl space below the structure holding food, water, and a carefully preserved elf body.

Table 5–37: Dungeon Sound, Strange
1  Buzzing of thousands of cicadas threatens to drown out all but the loudest of conversations.
2  Clock ticks far more slowly than normal; each tick is followed by a deep, rumbling moan.
3  Distant tinkling as if from a number of small bells, faint but persistent, is carried on the wind.
4  Dozens of light, pattering footfalls accompanied by giggling childish echo.
5  Far-off echo of an ululating war cry resounds all around.
6  Hysterical, high-pitched laughter rings out, trailing off into quiet sobbing.
7  Jagged screech of sharp metal across hard slate ends with a ringing like the drawing of steel.
8  Jarring, discordant notes of a song played on several musical instruments all out of tune.
9  Long, sustained scraping noise is followed by a heavy, dull thud.
10  Loud slurping noise, like marrow being sucked from a bone, comes from up ahead.
11  Loud squealing is cut off abruptly just as it hits its crescendo.
12  Loud tick tock of an enormous, unseen clock keeps time with the party's footsteps.
13  Rhythmic thumping of drums rises from somewhere deep down in a cavern.
14  Sepulchral moan like the lament of a hundred sorrowful dead reverberates, with no clear source.
15  Shrieking laughter of excited children breaks the quiet.
16  Strangled cry of a beast is cut short, followed by a baying howl.
17  Sucking sound of heavy boots walking through clinging mud can be heard off in the darkness.
18  Susurrus of dozens of voices layer upon one another into an indecipherable noise.
19  Sweet song sung by an angelic voice drifts through the air in an otherwise dark, foul place.
20  Trilling whistle cuts through all other sounds, its pitch so high that it is almost painful.

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?

Table 5–53: Dungeon Captives
1  Adun Eltone. An important local merchant, he was abducted for ransom. He could reward the party well for his rescue.
2  Alsiril. This half-elf bard allowed himself to be captured. He wants to write an epic tale of suffering and loss, and felt that experiencing captivity would help his research. 
3  Ciel'ra Lerein. A human assassin who has come here to study certain vile practices with the inhabitants. He stays in the dungeons because he likes it. All his possessions are within easy reach.
4  El-Setha. She is the only surviving member of an adventuring company that assaulted this dungeon a few weeks ago. She's a decent fighter, if weak from her time in captivity.
5  Einker Vasluit. A human warrior captured during a failed attack by a local lord on the dungeon inhabitants.
6  Fermus. A human rogue caught infiltrating the dungeon. He seems to have a reckless disregard for danger.
7  Hiroctas. A member of the same race as the owners of the dungeon pleads with the party to let him out. He is kept in here, and is let out only for battles, because he is a dangerous psychotic.
8  Jeremiah Jayson. A human farmer captured in a surface raid, he's been working as a slave for nearly a month, and looks much worse for the wear.
9  Joderine. A very, very old human who has been in the dungeons so long, she can't remember much more about herself than her first name. She clearly suffers from dementia, and has given names to all the vermin in her cell.
10  Kelsa No'Rath. A lady of the No'Rath noble house, her escorts were killed and she was captured while traveling nearby. She probably would have been eaten, but her appearance and belongings hinted at her wealth, so her captors are going to ransom her. 
11  Kerg Ironwrack. A shaman of a rival humanoid clan eyes the party warily. His captors hope to ransom him to his tribe.
12  Ko-Ro'arn. A duergar who moved too near the surface in search of gold. He is more than a little surly, but can be a good source of information about the world below if approached correctly.      
13  Lanilira Eliswosh. An elf archer and advanced scout from the nearby Whisltethyme clan. While spying on her captors, she got careless, and was caught and imprisoned. She has not been tortured, yet.
14  Petar Grailwatcher. Dwarf illusionist of some small renown, he has been here since his disappearance six months ago. He is well-treated and surprisingly hale; he has kept himself alive by entertaining his captors daily. 
15  Sabol. A half-elf ranger who strayed too far into his captors' territory. He's languished for months.
16  Silva Moralin. A human cleric of a good deity, she is going to be sacrificed to the dungeon denizens' god. She is shackled and has already been partially prepped for sacrifice.
17  Sarynia. Bruised pixie with tattered wings, held in a tiny, dirty cage. She has a haunted look and was subjected to all manner of torment. The cage has some form of permanent invisibility purge on it.
18  Theskern. A member of the same race as the dungeon inhabitants, he is a dissident opposed to their ideals and will aid the party against the ruling members of his people if they meet whatever conditions are appropriate.
19  Thinduaal Pickaxe. A dwarf miner from the Blackrock clan, separated from his people on an expedition where he got too greedy. He followed a small vein of gold, kept secret from his fellows.
20  Wythri Odaemas. Formerly a human wizard, she died here in the dungeon and returned as a wraith, filled with hate for all living things. She attacks the party as soon as they try to free her from her chains.

The Dead
Table 5–73: Killing Blows 1
1  As the body collapses, a limb goes flying, causing another foe to duck or be hit
2  As you double-slash your foe's abdomen, he drops what he has to hold in his remaining lifeblood
3  As the foe's spine gives way, his body slumps around his bones
4  As you pierce his neck and head, your foe's eyes roll wide, his arms flail, and he falls fast to the floor
5  Blood and teeth go spraying in a cone from behind the opponent
6  The blow shatters your foe's hand down to a jagged stump; his only weapon now is splintered bone
7  Caving into the foe's leg and foot, bone bursts through his boot; he topples like a sack of wet mash
8  The creature flails the stump of his limb about is if it could regrow anew while his life fades
9  Crunching noises pervade the air as your blow sinks heavily into your foe's cranium
10  Cursing the gods as he slumps over, your foe reaches inside the wound to hold in his innards
11  Disbelief and confusion crosses the face of your foe even as he gurgles blood and falls limp
12  Fists of rage suddenly open as your foe's veins fail, releasing his maroon mess to the ground
13  Foe's arms fly wide as he realizes his mortal time is at an end, and falls backward in a bloodpool
14  Foe drops everything and collapses, shuddering and dying from shock and blood loss
15  Foe's face is no more, his nose and eyes driving into the far reaches of his skull
16  Foe quivers in a macabre dance of agony as its body slowly ceases to function
17  Foe releases an uncharacteristic high-pitched scream as he dies before hitting the ground
18  Foe spins from the force of the attack, sending an arc of crimson across nearby combatants
19  Force of your attack doubles your opponent over, his head cracking open on the ground
20  Gritting away the pain with a look of defiance, your foe slowly slides to the ground in his own juices
Table 5–74: Killing Blows 2
1  The head and neck sink into the torso as an overhead chop sends the foe immediately to the floor
2  In wide-eyed horror your foe grips the weapon still protruding from his torso, and falls
3  Lifeblood spills on the ground, causing your fallen foe to trip on his own entrails in his death throes
4  The lower jaw of your opponent is shattered; wide-eyed pain and despair ride his corpse down
5  The multiple cracking of ribs accompanies the grimace on the face of your foe as he falls
6  Nearby foes nearly fall from the slippery, shattered mass your foe has become from your final blow
7  Sanguine display showers the area as your foe quakes and topples over limp
8  A tremendous thud accompanies the blow into your foe's torso, followed by a gurgle and a wretch
9  You are awash in the remains of your foe, breaking the mortal cage which once held him together
10  You are sprayed with blood as your wide-eyed foe emptily grabs the wound to prevent his death
11  You sweep the legs out from under your foe, rending them and dropping his remains flat
12  Your awesome hit sends your foe somersaulting backward as teeth fly through the air
13  Your blow cleaves full into your foe's stomach, lifting him into the air
14  Your blow nearly rends your foe in twain as he releases a curdling scream and falls backward
15  Your blow sinks into flesh and bone alike; a muffled crunching sound echoes from the foe's maw
16  Your blow takes the leg out from under the victim as his body collapses downward into a mass
17  You cleave a limb and sink deep into his torso and your foe dies instantly from blood loss and shock
18  Your foe bites his own tongue off from the demonic pain heaped upon him by your true blow
19  Your weapon slides through your foe to the hilt; you kick him off your weapon into a quivering pile
20  The wound is clean, but a moment later in horror the foe gasps up a gallon of blood, drowning in it

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–77: Scenes of Carnage 1
1  Bloated corpses lie about the area, watery entrails leaking from their weapon-stabbed remains
2  Blood sprays at odd angles around the room, as if wounds came from all sides; yet no bodies remain
3  Blood streaks betray the multiple corpses in the room, indicating they were deliberately moved

19  Victims of mass whipping lie about, skin flayed and draped across the ground between the bodies

Empty Rooms
Table 5–104: Empty Rooms 1
1  Abandoned room used as a garbage pit and cesspool for nearby residents, the smell is both overwhelming and ripe.
2  Against the nearby wall is an ancient forge and foundry, the fires long cold and tools broken and shattered about as if in anger.
3  Ancient tapestries in need of repair crawl with ruinous vermin and must have been very valuable back in their time.
4  Angled corners built of wood try to turn this otherwise square room into a hexagonal chamber, but were unfinished.
5  Animal corpses lie against the walls, with massive marks from desperate claws scratched on the walls. The smell of ancient decay hangs in the air, adding to the gruesome nature of the scene.
6  Ash from burned wood lies in a pile in the center of the room as the aroma of a recent meal mixes with the wood fire smell.
7  Banners of a nearby kingdom preserved from days of old lie in tribute throughout this room lit by a faint magical glow.
8  Barrels cover the entire room;,with a single small passage between them leading to a far wall. It smells musty and decayed.
9  Bas-reliefs of ancient dwarven runes (warning and danger) are carved up and down the walls of this room with intricate precision.
10  Bat guano covers the floor of this room, heavily booted tracks lead about the room as if someone was exploring in earnest.
11  Below a floor of crystal lies a perfectly laid-out skeletal form of a dragon wearing a crown of bone and having eyes of gemstones.
12  Blast marks of sunburst power are splashed about the far walls as if someone had cast mighty combat spells at one time.
13  Bones piled in the shape of a pyramid are in the very center of this room, a single grinning fanged skull at the very top.
14  Bookshelves of moldy, forgotten lore sit piled haphazardly about. A teak box, no bigger than a skull, sits off to one side.
15  Careful examination shows that every corner of this room has deliberately been carved to be rounded and not have straight angles.
16  Carvings of a great volcano erupting and laying waste to an ancient city are masterfully executed in great detail into one wall.
17  Ceiling blocks appear to be slowly dislodging as plant roots peek through the cracks and water drips slowly onto the smooth stone floor.
18  Cell bars sit in the corner of this room, betraying its use as a prison or jail; the smell of sweat and decay is strong here.
19  Center of the floor is drawn has summoning runes drawn in charcoal and ash. Candles and small sharp serrated blades lie scattered.
20  Coarse rat hairs lie scattered about this room, and crumbs of food lie in the corners.
 

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–105: Empty Rooms 2
1  Cobwebs of long dead spiders cling wistfully to all the corners, as spider corpses lie about the floor.
2  Construction of a door leading from this room began but was abandoned; no tools are found.
3  Cracks appear on all the walls as if pressure from above is both constant and aggressive.
4  Crude, simple benches face one bare wall, but no altar, dais, shrine, or holy monument can be seen.
5  Cubby holes built into the walls of this room each contain a personal study with desk, chair, and ink, all unused for some time.
6  Dark gray marble covers the mosaic floor with lines of bloodstone set like lightning bolts.
7  Dozens of black iron candle holders nearly three feet high are propped up, the candles long extinguished, melted wax all around.
8  Egress/portcullis set in the ceiling but no visible lever or catch to control its position.
9  Entire floor is warped and rippled across, making footing dangerous; wall sconces hang empty.
10  Exquisite statue of a human woman in plate armor stands in a corner; her hand poised up as if to cover her face from danger.
11  Faded words carved into the wall are still legible: "The gods will grant me justice."
12  Flecks of metal lie near a pile of burned wood, the smell reminiscent of a black smith's workshop.
13  Footprints in the dust show someone entering, walking along the perimeter and leaving...
14  For a moment listeners seem to hear faint footfalls echoing throughout this room as of someone dashing for cover, but there is nothing within.
15  Four two-foot-wide circular pits sit in opposite corners; faint scraping noises come from within
16  Four sarcophagi lean against a nearby wall, their lids loose but still covering whatever lies within
17  Garish emerald colors were sloppily applied to all the corners; sacks of dried leaves lie open
18  Gold food platters are fixed crudely to the ceiling by iron spikes driven in at odd angles
19  Grating covers a wide pit nearly the size of the room, with dark, oily water beneath
20  Hanging braziers in the corners of the room glow brightly from the materials within, the ceiling concealed by thick smoke

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–106: Empty Rooms 3
1  Illusory sound and light play a quick dark tune on an unseen wind instrument, suggesting doom and despair.
2  In a small recess in the center of the room lies a book with covers of stone, a seven-pointed star carved into its face.
3  In one corner is the intact skeleton of some huge giant, still curled in a fetal position but bones completely stripped of meat.
4  Iron cauldron of immense size hangs suspended above an alchemical fire flashing different colors heating the liquid within.
5  Iron maiden leans against the far wall, a pair of wide-open eyes staring out of the facial slit in stark terror.
6  Large basin of hot coals burns slowly against the far wall, illuminating the entire chamber in a crimson hue of unease.
7  Large crudely-made wooden coffin is in the very center of the room, a padlock used to lock shut the heavy lid.
8  Leathery giant batlike wings from some poor creature have been nailed crudely against the walls providing gruesome covering.
9  Loose flooring has collapsed a section of the floor. Slime coats the far wall and an acidic liquid has collected in the uneven floor.
10  Loose tiles cover the floor in no particular order; in places the largest tiles have been shattered with a hammer or maul.
11  Magical light emanating from the room's center ceiling shines down on a meticulously detailed angelic statue resting there.
12  Marks of tar splatter about the aged and cracked stone floor and walls. After close inspection, the tar appears to be an unidentifiable ichor, fused to the stone.
13  Matching the horrible smell, one corner reveals a large pile of moldy food and sewage while another is the scene of carnage and butchery.
14  Mining tools and twisted maps lie about the chamber as if excavation work was about to begin, but no progress has been made.
15  Miniscule puncture holes in various places throughout the room exude a strange smoke akin to incense, but much stronger.
16  Mirrors in the corners reflect the light from many torches set in wall sconces and draw the eye to many dancing shadows.
17  Moisture from an unseen source permeates the room, coating clothing and flesh and dampening hair; animals are skittish.
18  Mold clings to the wall where a small trickle of water passes through a crack and runs onto the floor, making a puddle of mud and grime.
19  Mold clings to the walls of this room and watery slime runs down to the floor, where it collects in the center, which is slightly angled in and depressed.
20  Moldy old mattresses have been affixed to the ceiling, floor, and walls of this chamber in an attempt to "pad" it for some reason.

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–107: Empty Rooms 4
1  Mushrooms and fungi cover the entire floor like some exotic, fantastic carpet, occasionally twitching and moving away from something underneath.
2  Near the door lie the remains of an old falling spike trap, long since sprung and never reset.
3  Oily rags and empty tin vials are thrown in a corner. A single workbench of immense size, missing a leg, is against the far wall. Random broken tools lie scattered on the bench.
4  Old barrels marked with an unknown stamp lie about; the strong vinegar smell of wasted wine permeates the room, mixing with decay and dust.
5  Old bookshelves are set into the walls. A pile of books lie together in the center of the room, dissolved by acid or magic.
6  Old wood cots rest against the walls. Vermin-infested blankets and sheets lie scattered about the room. On one cot sits a small barrel and on another a rusted sword.
7  Old rope bridge gives a way to cross this room with a deep and murky water-filled crevasse across the room's center. The rope is frayed in places, suggesting its overuse.
8  On a stone slab in the room's center lies an ancient parchment with arcane symbols and crude drawings of catfish lie in the margins. The slab is otherwise untouched.
9  Once a laboratory, a shattered table points to broken glass, rubber tubing, and colored powderabout the room. No liquids remain, perhaps evaporated years ago.
10  Once-fine tapestries fill the room with now-faded scenes of battle glory and demonic figures. The rugs are soiled and the corners of the room filled with dust and lint.
11  One wall shows evidence of burns, except for the center of the wall with a humanoid outline. The room is otherwise clean, all the evidence of its use burned away.
12  Open crates marked with a well-known merchant house name are pushed to one side, hay and packing material scattered about.
13  Painted in blood with an unskilled hand stands the avatar of a dark god, as well as his holy symbol.
14  Perfect rendition of a spider has been cut into the floor, each leg stretching to touch a nearby wall segment.
15  Pieces of broken axe handles, great clubs, and other wooden objects appear tossed into the room.
16  Piles of rusted, crushed, and partially dissolved armor pieces and shields are in this chamber, some with surviving maker marks.
17  Pipes stick out of the walls at odd angles aiming into the room. They appear to be made of iron and faint wind whistling can be heard.
18  Planks of wood, finished doors with iron bands, and piles of finished hinge work lie about this chamber awaiting use.
19  Pool of perpetually bubbling lava lies in the center of this room; deep scented brimstone assaults the senses. Oddly, there is no heat, despite the rising vapors.
20  Poorly concealed false door hangs open against one wall; a thin rope attached to its handle lies limply in the room's center.
 

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–108: Empty Rooms 5
1  Rats scatter at the intrusion here, making their way into tiny burrows gnawed into the room's corners and cubbyholes.
2  Recently a fire had to have wracked this chamber. The telltale smells of extinguished fire and flame are strong but nothing can be seen. It is actually hard to breathe.
3  Remains of a camp are evident. A sleeping bag and simple tools were left behind by a lone explorer not long ago. (See tables 3–107 and 3–108 for more).
4  Scratch marks on the floor and walls show someone was unwillingly dragged from this room.
5  Sections of the far stone wall have been worked by someone with magic trying to manipulate the shape or style of the stone.
6  Sets of torture equipment and tools of the trade lie scattered about. A whip encased in a glass box hangs on the far wall alongside a rack of tools, such as boards, pliers, thumbscrews, and tongs. 
7  Several sets of shredded dwarven-sized outfits lie about the floor. There is no evidence of a scuffle, and no bodies or blood to be found.
8  Simple common objects like a lanter, quill pen, parchment pages, and a brass urn float softly throughout the room from unseen magic.
9  Simple dais against the far wall leads to an unfinished altar made of brown basalt with what appear to be dried blood stains thereon.
10  Single lantern burns with a magical light inside. An iron covering with cut-out shapes allows the light to (confusingly) project larger ghosts on all the walls.
11  Single piece of thick rope hangs from a stone in the center of the room, literally coming out of the ceiling itself, not on a hook.
12  Single stone sarcophagus seemingly has no lid. Ancient runes are carved around the room at the very top near the ceiling.
13  Single wall once dividing the room in half has recently crumbled down, littering the surrounding floor with loose rubble. A single pick axe protrudes from under the rubble.
14  Six pillars stretching from floor to ceiling hold up the ceiling of this large room. Rusted manacles dangle loosely from each pillar, the locks broken open long ago.
15  Skeletons suspended from the neck hang limply from the walls, as if their heads were melded with the stone and trapped.
16  Sliding flagstones in the floor reveal a nearly 30-foot-deep pit with old, moldy skeletons impaled on spikes below.
17  Slime runs from corner to corner, creating both treacherous footing and an odd, stinging smell that assaults the senses and attracts all manner of parasitic insects.
18  Small circle of runes no more than a foot around are off to one side, each rune a different color and of unknown origin.
19  Small darts lie scattered about the floor, each showing it was once coated with a filmy liquid. A wooden board on the wall suggests this was once a training room or interrogation chamber.
20  Small figurines of mounted humanoid figures each wielding a lance sit atop a table on some sort of mosaic game board
 

? CHAPTER FIVE  ?
Table 5–109: Empty Rooms 6
1  Someone spent time hanging wire and tapestries attempting to divide this room into different sections for whatever reason.
2  Spots of ice mark the otherwise unadorned walls of this chamber. Icicles hang down from the ceiling and the room is somewhat cold, but not freezing.
3  Statues of what appear to be kings only four feet high are carved out of the room's walls, each wielding a different, unique weapon.
4  Stone slabs jut out at violent angles from the various walls, each big enough to support a human-sized body.
5  Strewn about the floor are dozens of helmets of various sizes and design, some from lost empires or nations that have sinced changed their army uniforms.
6  Thick layers of undisturbed dust reveal this room has not been used in quite some time despite the apperance of half-eaten food and bits of cloth.
7  Thin inch-wide canals zigzag, only an inch deep, across the floor acting as a reservoir for some forgotten ritual or experiment.
8  Three sets of rusted iron shackles line the wall with two long-since dried-out skeletons lying in a pile on the floor, the skulls crushed under a heavy weight of some kind long ago.
9  Two corpses lay face-down in a pile of coins, their long-dried blood staining the coins and treasures they have fallen into.
10  Two crumbled stone supports stand on either side of a rubble pile, bones peeking out from under the dirt and shattered stone.
11  Two stone statues guard the doorway. Nails mark the wall as if a great work of art once hung here.
12  Unnatural shade and gloom permeate this room; sometimes glimpses of shadows can be seen swimming within.
13  Various bones of small rodents lie along the floor, as does the shed skin of a small snake.
14  Various scrape marks of differing sizes crisscross the floor of this room, some barely scratching the stone and others carving deep.
15  Walls of this chamber are covered with gory, jagged spikes. A grate in the floor leads to a dark pit.
16  Weapon racks adorn the walls of this room, with quite a few holding intricately worked scythes with handles of bone.
17  What appears to be a living tree "grows" in the center of this room, no doubt kept alive by magic. Elven runes adorn the walls.
18  Wooden chest against the far wall was opened and looted long ago; poison spikes still protrude from the shattered lock.
19  Wooden man-size doll stands battered in the center of the room; one arm lies on the floor cleanly cut off.
20  Wooden table has been set to block entrance to this room; spikes are protruding through as if impaled from the rear.

Magic Items

Table 6–1: Magic Item Creation Flavor
1  Bind an incorporeal spirit to the item or hold it long enough to impart its knowledge or actual essence into the item's suite of powers.
2  Clear your mind of outside thoughts, stop all activities, and be away from companions in order to reach perfect concentration.
3  Contact your mentor or superior via magic for advice or blessings and perhaps to borrow some of his or her power.
4  If pious, create a shroud with runes of the appropriate deity to wrap the item in during its final creation process.
5  Keep accurate records with tablets, hourglasses, and candles for the exact length of time of each incantation for precision and perfection.
6  Take extra special care of any familiar or animal companion with whom your bond will be strained by putting all energies into item creation.
7  Meditate on command words, phrases, or item activation methods. The symbols or words may come to you in visions and will need to be deciphered.
8  Repeatedly chant special formulas over the item in whispers or other tongues, and with motions over the item with a fetish, focus, or holy symbol in hand.
9  Research ancient heroes or similar magic items from legend dealing with the powers of your item to imbue the item with the specific abilities of the original.
10  Send the item dipping briefly into the ethereal or astral plane (or singular demiplane) to absorb some of the passing powers of the multiverse.
11  Summon and harness a tiny or fine-sized inevitable or elemental servant to aid in the meticulous details in decorating the item.
12  Use magic to clean dust, keep out unwanted noises, or create superior surroundings for crafting the item in a perfectly pure environment.
13  Build a temporary sheath, vice, or rack to encase the item and help attract and attune magical energies; the container dissolves upon creation.
14  Carve exceptional runes of great deeds or people related to the power of the item in hopes of attracting the powers to the item.
15  Contact a celestial or infernal for the blessing or curse to use your own hair or blood to help infuse the item.
16  Deal with a djiin to impart some of its powers to enhance the item, and perhaps hold it while the final spells are placed within.
17  Deal with an elemental to place some of its essence into the item, perhaps even bathing the item in the element for a day.
18  Harness the power of the weather (wind, lightning, rain, sun) through summoning and command magic to bathe the item in.
19  Have an exceptionally strong fighter (weapon or armor), deft rogue or bard (wondrous item), fellow arcanist (staff or wand), or cleric of your faith (holy item or protection) try out, model, and offer insight to their ways.
20  Research ancient secrets using tomes, books, scrolls, and tablets, and use your creation skills to channel the lore directly through you into the item.

? CHAPTER SIX ?

Table 6–15: Magic Item History
1  The item was made about 90 years ago. Forged by dwarves, the maker's name is a mystery. Dwarves tell the story of it slaying a great wyrm. It was thought destroyed by the Order of Righteous Atonement in the City-State of Helios. Bards think its maker was a dragon in disguise.
2  The item was created over 800 years ago. There does not seem to be any exotic material used in its creation. The item was forged by humans far to the east. Wise men say it took part in the slaying of a mighty lich. Lore links it with the wizard Kennul the Great, and sages say it is sought by the White Walkers Cult.
3  The item was forged nearly 850 years ago. There are slight traces of mithral in its manufacture. The item was forged by goblinoids near the town of Ballinstock. Legends have forgotten the blade, thinking it a mere toy of goblins. Lore links it to a druid named Wortimel. Who have even said it was forged under a full moon.
4  The item is probably over 400 years old. It was forged by the dwarven soulsmith Oribindu, near Old Kranalar. Eastern monks say it was used to banish a great lizard king or serpentine warlord. Whatever other secrets the item holds are lost.
5  The item is not old; estimated construction took place about 115 years ago. There does not seem to be any exotic material used in its manufacture. The item was forged by dwarves far to the southeast. Those dwarves say it took part in the downfall of a great vampire cult. It was last owned by the ambassador Gelda, the Binder of Truth.
6  The item's age is difficult to pinpoint. The item was forged by an unknown human hand, far to the west. The elf lord Rinlenial used the weapon during his crusade in the Forest of Woe. It was thought to have been destroyed by a monk, but rumors persist that it is buried in a tomb. It is still mentioned in song and story nationwide.
7  The item's age is hard to ascertain. Dwarves forged the item, possibly near Cryn Durnel. Some say its maker was a genius. A druid named Futhasol was last known to possess it, although it is unknown if he destroyed it or not.
8  The item is over 1,000 years old and there are traces of gemstones in its creation. The item was forged by orcs, possibly near Grymfog Hill. Orcs claim is was made to destroy dragons. Selayth, a sage, knows its true power.
9  The item's age seems impossible to divine, but it bears the signature of Alna Syllen, an elven smith near Erinwell. Elves say a human ranger, Belor, stole the item before it was lost to time.
10  The item is just over 400 years old. Sages record that a god's blood and claws were used in its creation, so that it might later be used to destroy a mighty demon. It is now sought by a holy order of nomads.

? CHAPTER SIX ?
11  The item's age is hard to discern. There are slight traces of aberration essence in its manufacture. Dwarves forged the item near Kryn Karran. The creator etched "Falonak" in runes on the hilt, but songs say the maker was mad.
12  The item's age is hard to discern without advanced study, but there are no traces of special material used in its making. The item was forged by celestials, but exactly where is unknown. Tales say it took part in the legendary campaigns of the ghaele. Sages link it to the god of knowledge. What secrets this item holds are unknown.
13  The item's age is about 500 years old, when it was forged by dwarves, possibly near Anar Bhor.Gilkascral, the dwarven smith, crafted it. Poets say it was used to kill the hero Protus Nodor, who is remembered in songs. Lore links it with a rogue named Rosha the Red. Nothing else is known about the item.
14  The item could have been forged over 600 years ago. There might even be traces of a meteorite in it. Humans forged the item - the exact maker's name is lost to time - near Kragenmoor. Monks claim it took over a hundred men to craft it. History links it to Lyrvan the Commanding and his victories over the gnoll lord of Ulyag.
15  The item is over 400 years with traces of obsidian in its manufacture. The item's crafter is unknown, but elves say it was used to banish a devil and that the fey aided in its creation. Lore is slim at best, and attempts to find a last owner have been futile due to time and a lack of credible stories.
16  The item is over 700 years old. The item's manufacture is simple and almost elementary, which comes as no surprise, since it was forged by ogres, Chajkl to be exact, near the Forest of Athmore. Historians claim it was used to defeat a great lizardfolk cult which followed the black wyrm Dunig'graz (which few believe), while bardic lore links it with a hermetic cleric named Olafsool.
17  The item is less than 150 years old, with slight traces of infernal essence. Humans forged the item near Kalastan but the creator's name has been forgotten. Whispers tell of a demon stripping the man's name from history. History tells of three kings dying from its power. Yet there are those who still seek it.
18  The item's age is impossible to ascertain. Since no exotic materials were used in its creation, it's hard to tell where it even came from. Rumors persist of a dragon forging it, but no proof has ever existed. Tales range from evil men destroying cities with it to idealistic wizards rebuilding entire nations. It is though the weapon came from nothing.
19  The item's age is difficult to pinpoint, and with traces of dragon essence in its manufacture, it is impossible to scry. The item was forged by a now-extinct family of elves near Ardin-Narr. The rise of the villainous Herise the Torturer is associated with the item, but bardic lore links it with Cathlin the Wrecker. Lastly, legends claim the creator was no elf at all, but a dragon in disguise.
20  The item was created perhaps 500 years ago. There are traces of giant blood in its creation.Since it was forged by the dark elves of Athvar Fen, it is quite possible that demon eggs were used.There are no markings denoting the creator, however. Determining the true source of its power is difficult. Dwarves say it took part in the death of a powerful ice elf queen, which many suspect is simply myth and conjecture. Lore links it to a monk named Orlan. Sages claim that a true ice elven champion will rise, chosen by the god of battle and favored among her followers. She will take the item and become a new avatar. If such a thing were to happen, all elvenkind would fall.

Table 6–103: Haunted Locales
1  Arbor Wood: The spirits of this wood have caused the trees and shrubs to warp into unnatural archways. Trespassers and their remains can be found hanging in the arches from thorny vines.
2  Butcher's Mire: A brutal killer was chased into the woody swamp and executed by the guard. The locals say he still preys on anyone foolish enough to enter the swampy forest.
3  Chessup Barn: Old man Chessup's son went mad and killed himself in this huge red building, the house and outlying buildings haven't been used since due to unexplained occurrences.
4  Crazy Quinn's: This huge tree has the remnants of a house in its branches - once the home of a slightly mad hermit that traded with locals.  His body was found missing its head.
5  Dark Grove: This stand of stones was once a druid's grove. Now it is twisted and defiled. No one admits to the deed, Nature spirits once guarding the shrine are trapped there, crying for release.
6  Darken Fields: Locals advise not to travel this section of road at night; ghostly forms fly by and take off with the unwise.
7  Esfir's Mark: A gypsy caravan was killed and burned in this secluded spot by an angry mob.  The ground is scorched and dark to this day. The nomad spirits remain trapped until vindicated.
8  Frostfire's Rest: A mountain cave where an old red dragon with two breath weapons was killed by adventurers for its unique qualities and riches. Ever since then the mountain rumbles...
9  Ghoston: All the villagers here claim they have at least one ghost living with them in their homes. The spirits are generally friendly, but anyone threatening them risks their displeasure.
10  Graven's Wood: A bandit king buried treasure in this wood, when he was about to pass on he went back there and guards it even now.
11  Kevril's Library: This place is not a hall of books at all, but a forest. Ghostly abominations can be seen at night and those that enter the forest seeking ‘to learn' never return. 
12  Liberator's Rest: The entire population has recently been sacrificed to the Cult of Pestilence. A cultist introduced a potent disease that spread through town. The ghosts want peace.
13  Lover's Leap: Two lovers were chased to this ridge by bandits, the young man died defending the woman and she leapt off the cliff rather than get captured.
14  Nightmare Run: This dark section of road haunted by the spirit of a black horse, no one claims to remember why, but the creature tries to spook mounts and run them off the road.
15  Old Well: The buildings surrounding the boarded up well are abandoned. They say a dead body poisoned the water. When retrieved they found signs of wrongful death on the corpse. The victim's ghost wants revenge.
16  Rosewood: Many years ago during a war this forest was en route to a military base. It was entered by a unit of soldiers who stripped it of anything they found useful, destroying even things they didn't need. The forest fought back and killed them almost to a man. It still doesn't welcome visitors.
17  Sephra's Gem: Named for a traveling mapmaker, this small unassuming lake is filled with the sounds of frog calls during the day. At night this place houses the most terrifying sounds: screams, howls and cries for help can be heard at some distance.
18  Slaver's Ride: Once the well used road of a slave caravan, it's now usually called Freedom's Ride.  A rebellious slave was once beaten to death and his ghost now guards the area. 
19  Trenk's Rule: An orc scouting patrol lead by a particularly smart and ambitious orc was ambushed and killed here. The patrol's leader Trenk Stonerival couldn't accept his own death and now his ghost rules the area, killing any one, even other orcs and leaving grisly markers around his territory. 
20  Wayfarer's Rest: A roadhouse that now lays abandoned. The name still hangs over the door and noise can be heard from within, but there haven't been any visitors in years.
